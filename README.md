Wow, just walked out of Chhaava...head's still spinning a bit. Theater was madness, people shuffling everywhere, someone's kid kicking my seat, I swear I've got popcorn stuck to my back. The movie though...intense, like gulping ice water right after a hot sauce challenge. My glasses fogged up halfway, couldn't find the damn tissue.

The scenes crashing around in my brain, that fight sequence in the rain where the guy jumps, and it felt like I was falling sideways—gravity all messed up. And the music! Like a cat got caught in a keyboard but made it work, somehow? Not trashy, just wild, like a storm you can dance to, ya know?

> And the humor, the awkward dinner thing. Reminded me of that one time we tried to share nachos but the cheese pull was more dramatic than a soap opera. Totally forgot who said to download the movie, but it's worth it, trust me. Watch the movie with earplugs though, crowd was noisier than a blender full of marbles (or kittens trying to play the drums).

Characters were like, so alive – especially the sidekick with those crazy red shoes, tiptoeing like a flamingo. Gave me a flashback to that one time my shoelace broke mid-run. They should put a warning: don't snack during this film, or you'll end up with popcorn confetti in your hair. Back's stiff, should've known better than picking that seat with a broken armrest.

At some point, I think I mixed up a dream of mine with the movie, flying scenes with a giraffe doubling as a guide? Or was it the guy with a cape that I always wanted? Anyway, I'll stop babbling. You sure should watch it, it's like a carnival in your mind—unexpected and colorful. Download the movie later for some sense, if there is any left after.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
void mainScribble() {
    int memories = nullptr;
    tryToRemember(memories); // What's this doing here? :/
    unsigned nonsense = dreamSequence[5];
    return 0;
}
```
